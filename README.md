# SSRS Sales Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates the use of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to create interactive dashboards for monitoring and analyzing sales data.

## Project Overview

The **SSRS Sales Dashboard** provides insights into the following key metrics:
- **Sales by Year**: Visualizes sales data across different years (2011â€“2014) using a pie chart.
- **Sales Trend by Year/Month**: Displays sales trends over time, broken down by year and month, using a line chart.
- **Sales by Territory Group**: Uses a pyramid chart to show sales distribution across different regions (Pacific, Europe, North America).
- **Sales by Territory**: A bar chart that provides detailed sales data by individual territories such as Southwest, Canada, Northwest, and others.

## Key Components
- **Pie Chart**: Used to visualize sales by year (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014).
- **Line Chart**: Tracks sales growth and fluctuations month-over-month.
- **Pyramid Chart**: Shows territory sales distribution across different regions.
- **Bar Chart**: Detailed sales numbers by specific territories.

## How to Use the Reports

1. **Dataset**: Connect the SSRS reports to the appropriate SQL Server database that stores the sales data.
2. **Modify Connection Strings**: Ensure that the reports' connection strings are properly set to point to the correct data source.
3. **Deploy Reports**: Deploy the reports to your SSRS server or run them locally using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).

## SQL Queries

The following SQL queries were used to populate the dataset for these reports:

```sql
-- Example SQL query used for the Sales by Year report
SELECT 
    YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year,
    SUM(TotalAmount) AS Sales
FROM SalesOrders
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate);
